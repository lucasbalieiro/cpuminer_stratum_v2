## About This Toy Project

This is a personal project where I'm trying to learn how to "talk" to a Stratum V2 application.

It’s likely to be used with [`pleblottery`](https://github.com/vinteumorg/pleblottery).

Also, I'm dumb — I couldn’t understand the protocol just by reading the specs at [stratumprotocol.org](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification), so I'm trying to build something to figure it out for myself.

TODO:
- [ ] Be able to do a noise handshake with a mining server.
- [ ] Be able to `OpenStandardMiningChannel` with a mining server.
